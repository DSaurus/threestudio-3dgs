def rotate_on_spot(
    R: torch.Tensor, T: torch.Tensor, rotation: torch.Tensor
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    """
    Given a camera position as R and T (batched or not),
    and a rotation matrix (batched or not)
    return a new R and T representing camera position(s)
    in the same location but rotated on the spot by the
    given rotation. In particular the new world to view
    rotation will be the previous one followed by the inverse
    of the given rotation.

    For example, adding the following lines before constructing a camera
    will make the camera point a little to the right of where it
    otherwise would have been.

    .. code-block::

        from math import radians
        from pytorch3d.transforms import axis_angle_to_matrix
        angles = [0, radians(10), 0]
        rotation = axis_angle_to_matrix(torch.FloatTensor(angles))
        R, T = rotate_on_spot(R, T, rotation)

    Note here that if you have a column vector, then when you
    premultiply it by this `rotation` (see the rotation_conversions doc),
    then it will be rotated anticlockwise if facing the -y axis.
    In our context, where we postmultiply row vectors to transform them,
    `rotation` will rotate the camera clockwise around the -y axis
    (i.e. when looking down), which is a turn to the right.

    If angles was [radians(10), 0, 0], the camera would get pointed
    up a bit instead.

    If angles was [0, 0, radians(10)], the camera would be rotated anticlockwise
    a bit, so the image would appear rotated clockwise from how it
    otherwise would have been.

    If you want to translate the camera from the origin in camera
    coordinates, this is simple and does not need a separate function.
    In particular, a translation by X = [a, b, c] would cause
    the camera to move a units left, b units up, and c units
    forward. This is achieved by using T-X in place of T.

        where if neither n nor N is 1, then n and N must be equal.
